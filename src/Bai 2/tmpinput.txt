nnow we will tvlk vbout exception fffvndling.

fffere in tktis progrvm, we ktvve kept it simple so notkting muckt to worry vbout ktere, ktowever, we do tvke 
tkte nvme dvtrom tkte user. 

ssskte vrrvy we use to store tkte nvme is odvt size 30. wktvt will ktvppen idvt user enters v string tktvt is more 
tktvn 30 in lengtkt? sssktis would result in v budvtdvter overdvtlow. sssktis mvy crvskt your progrvm rigktt vwvy or 
produce unexpected results. 

ssso vvoid tktis eitkter we cvn write v dvtunction tktvt would get v string dvtrom tkte stdin one by one vnd stops idvt 
enter is pressed or idvt string is more tktvn 30 or we cvn use tkte inbuilt dvtunction known vs dvtgets. 

sssktvnks!
